## What is Proton?
Recently, Mozilla has revealed their upcoming UI refresh for Firefox deemed **Proton UI**.

The ProtonUI aims to enhance the experience of Firefox by making the entire UI more modern and minimal, with rounded corners, light shadows, and more.

<a href="https://winaero.com/enable-the-new-proton-design-in-firefox/">WinAero made a great article about ProtonUI, and the changes coming to Firefox.</a>

## What is ProtonPlus?
Firefox has, for many years, been a highly customizable browser, down to the littlest details through userChrome.css editing. 
The entire browser can be changed to look however you could want, from increasing the width of tabs, to autohiding the entire UI.

Although the Proton UI update is still in its early stages, there were still some things that I wanted to enhance, which is the purpose of ProtonPlus.

ProtonPlus is a collection of tweaks and enhancements to the existing Proton UI, to make it even more modern and minimal.

## Installation
Installing ProtonPlus is super simple. There are a few things to do, but I've layed out the entire process below.
### Prerequisites
* Ensure you have a non-stable channel of Firefox on your machine. This can be <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/">Beta, Dev, or Nightly</a>.
* Create the **chrome** folder for your profile by following <a href="https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html">this tutorial</a>.
### Installation
1. Follow <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-try-out-the-upcoming-firefox-redesign-now-1846221037">this tutorial</a> to enable the new ProtonUI refresh in Firefox.
2. <a href="https://github.com/Futur3Sn0w/FFProtonPlus/releases">Download the latest release of ProtonPlus</a>
3. Open your **chrome** folder, and extract the raw CSS files into the folder
4. Relaunch Firefox by closing and reopening, or by going to about:restartrequired and clicking **Restart Firefox**
5. Enjoy the new UI!
### Bonus tips
* ProtonPlus works in the native Light and Dark themes in Firefox, and can be automatically changed with <a href="https://github.com/skhzhang/time-based-themes/">this extension called automaticDark</a>
* Don't want certain elements to be changed? Simply edit the **userChrome.css** or any of the **.css** files to adjust the UI to your preferences.
* I recommend placing two flexible spaces before and after the URLbar to give it space, but that's up to you.
